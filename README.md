# TheWeatherIsTerrible
The weather is terrible. (Probably)

A faked weather app for CS492, it shows weather forcasts for 15 days starting on March 15th.
All the forcasts are bleak and make you wish that the weather wasnt so terrible. 
They are also include randomly generated temperatures and visibility values!

(Seriously, the all time low was -165C!)
